By the age of 16 I was a pretty good student at school and already four consecutive times national champion in sailing. Spending all of my childhood summers by the beach, I was hooked and totally in love with this lonely and eccentric sport, which I wanted to pursue for life. Soon though, it was clear that there was ‘no future’ for me to sail in Cyprus and the need get a ‘proper’ education arose. I was heartbroken.

In the 8 years that followed, I became a lawyer, a chartered accountant and ended up working with one of the ‘BIG 4’ accounting firms in London and in Boston, USA. Experiences that have enriched me with unforgettable moments and helped me grow in many ways. However, I always remembered how it felt to do something that you love and be totally passionate about…

At 25 I quit my corporate job to backpack Australia and SE Asia searching for answers and… more questions! Returning to Cyprus I soon chose the route of entrepreneurship, feeling that this was the ideal route to re-explore forgotten dreams and talents, face fears and hopefully give back to society a share of all my experiences.

I co-founded Vryonidou and Savvidou LLC; a boutique law firm based in Limassol and I am also a co-founder of Chrysalis LEAP Ltd; the first entrepreneurship accelerator program to be in Cyprus.

Today, through the tool of entrepreneurship, I focus on using my skills and experiences to help people design their lives and businesses in a manner aligned to their dreams and talents. Through that I am hoping that they themselves someday lead happier and more fulfilling lives and give their ‘little bit’ back to the world.
