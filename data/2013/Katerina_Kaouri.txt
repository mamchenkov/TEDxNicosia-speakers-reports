Dr Katerina Kaouri is an applied mathematician, with a penchant for good food, socializing, and dancing. She returned to Cyprus a couple of years ago, after more than a decade abroad, where she travelled extensively, coming across some extraordinary people and ideas. She holds a DPhil in Applied Mathematics from Oxford University, a Bachelors’ in Mathematics from Cambridge University, and Masters' degrees from Oxford University and Columbia University. Katerina has also worked for some time as a business consultant for a variety of clients and industries, and had the chance to put mathematical analysis to practice when taking business decisions. She currently teaches at Intercollege and the Cyprus University of Technology and does research in –sometimes unexpected- applications of mathematics in real life.

Science communication is one of her passions: helping people overcome their fears about science and mathematics, and delivering information in digestible and enjoyable ways. She has presented her work at several scientific conferences and other events; at Oxford, she was awarded the first prize for the university’s best popularized talk in the Sciences in her year. She was also one of the finalists at the Cyprus FAMELAB 2011 competition, and the coordinator of the first science festival in Cyprus.

She is fascinated by real stories that sound like fiction, and in her spare time she also dabbles in film-making, and some other artsy things.
