Roddy repatriated to Cyprus ten years ago, having run two successful restaurants in Johannesburg, South Africa, Roddy has always been rather unique. He’s never been the type of chef who keeps to a tried and tested formula. Instead, he likes to take the traditional, take it apart and then put it back together in his unique way.

His culinary creativity, mixed with a pure passion for food inherited and absorbed from many key figures in his life means that every time he cradles a spoon or fondles an ingredient, his love for his craft emanates through every morsel he makes.

Since stirring up the culinary scene in Cyprus, Roddy has made a name for himself as one of the island’s most celebrated chefs. Not content to stand back and watch the pot boil, Roddy also runs highly popular cookery workshops, either as a one-off or as part of a series and thrives on the passion and fun he brings to the willing participants.

Then there is his cooking programme on national television and appearances on international food shows which have not only allowed him to become a culinary household name, it’s also exposed viewers to the infinite possibilities and variations available in the Cypriot kitchen.

The amount of interest and adoration generated by this man of all seasonings has also resulted in the significant gourmet accolades adorning the walls of Ta Piatakia/ Little Plates Restaurant. From the highly coveted Time Out awards to other prestigious gourmet magazine certifications, there is obviously a reason he has been filmed and featured with international chefs, including England’s Tonia Buxton on the Discovery Network and other renowned European chefs.
