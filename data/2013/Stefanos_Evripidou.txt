Stefanos Evripidou is chief reporter at the English-language national newspaper, Cyprus Mail. His main beat is politics, energy and the economy though he often covers issues relating to human rights and migration.

He experienced life as a student abroad in the late 1990s when he studied Law in the UK. In 2005, he took a mid-career break to complete a Masters in International Conflict Studies in London. In the last 11 years, his work has seen him travel across the globe, reporting from Delhi to Istanbul, Dublin to Kosovo on a broad range of issues. He has interviewed a wide range of people from detained asylum seekers on hunger strike to presidents and foreign ministers, as well as fascinating characters like Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the body double of Saddam Hussein's notorious son Uday.

He has been awarded twice for articles written on refugees and migration, winning first prize in 2011 and second prize the year before.
In 2010, he was one of three Greek Cypriot journalists invited to interview a Turkish prime minister for the first time, as part of a short-lived effort to close the gap in communications betweenTurkey and Cyprus.

He has been invited to speak at a number of conferences on the political situation in Cyprus, as well as on migration and asylum and the role of the media. His online work includes a weekly podcast on all things Cypriot during 2010 and the production of a short series of video blogs on efforts to teach history in a frozen conflict. He recently produced and co-directed a 40-minute documentary on the conflicting historical narratives of the conflict in Cyprus, which premiered in August 2012 at the Lemesos International Documentary Festival.
